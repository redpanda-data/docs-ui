= Limited Availability Test Page
:page-limited-availability: true
:description: This page tests the Limited Availability badge in the UI preview.

This page demonstrates the new **Limited Availability** badge feature.

== Orange Badge Locations

The orange "Limited Availability" badge should appear in three places:

1. **Below this title** - In the main content area
2. **In the TOC** (right side) - When you scroll, it appears in the sticky navigation
3. **In the left nav** - An additional (Limited) will be shown next to the page title in the left navigation

== Test the Tooltip

Hover over any of the badges to see the tooltip text:

_"This feature has limited availability. Contact Redpanda Support for access."_

== Compare with Beta

This is different from the beta badge which:

* Uses blue color
* Shows as `(beta)` in the left nav
* Has different tooltip text about testing and production

== Page Content

Adding some content here so you can scroll and see the badge appear in the sticky TOC navigation.

=== Subsection 1

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. The badge should remain visible as you scroll.

=== Subsection 2

More content to enable scrolling. Check that the orange badge appears in the TOC when you scroll past the main title.

=== Subsection 3

Additional content for testing the sticky navigation behavior.

== Status Badge Guidelines

Use `:page-limited-availability: true` for features that:

* Require contacting Redpanda Support for access

* Need special licensing or approval
* Have restricted regional availability
